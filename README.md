# How to use this repository

This is a presentation about the Spock testing framework, with supporting materials.  Each directory is a separate Gradle project.

* `Spock.pptx` is the actual presentation
* `spock-samples/` contains the code samples shown in the presentation
* `enterprise-service-incomplete/` contains an incomplete enterprise service
    * The desired end result is explained in the presentation itself
    * This is supposed to be completed via TDD mob programming during the presentation
    * I would recommend starting by fleshing out `StatusServiceSpec` and `StatusService`, then writing a `StatusControllerSpec` and `StatusController`
* `enterprise-service-complete/` contains a sample completion of the enterprise service
